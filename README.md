# CUNY Buzz Website
CUNY Buzz is a Facebook messenger bot that allows you to search for registered campus specific events. We have a website (http://cunybuzz.me/website/) for club officers and other authorized persons to submit their event to our database. To do so please fill out the form on the site. Make sure to include all fields otherwise the form will be considered invalid.

The bot was built in node.js using the Facebook Messenger API. It was trained using API.AI and is currently hosted on Heroku. The bot can currently only relate events that occur in Brooklyn College, however it will slowly be implemented across CUNY. The website was built using HTML, CSS, Jquery, and githubpages.
